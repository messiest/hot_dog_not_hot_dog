# Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow: Hotdog vs. Not Hotdog

### 1. First I scraped the images from the internet, primarily using Image.net

### 2. Then I augmented more of these images because neural networks are not very great predictors with a small amount of data.

### 3. Built a Convolutional Neural Network in TensorFlow to classify images.

### 4. Run saved model and plot confusion matrix

### 5. Run final check on model


All of these steps will automatically happen after running the master script once.

The entire process takes about 6 hours.
